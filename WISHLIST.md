### Testing

- Unit testing
- End-to-End testing
- Component testing
- Cross browser compatability testing

### Dependency optimization

If I had a little more time I must remove the used npm packages and build my own.

### Virtualize Long Lists

I must add pagination to avoid scrolling the page in case there are more records.

### Avoiding Index

It's not much used but still I want to use record key instead of using index to identify DOM elements properly and to avoid issues while pushing/removing a record.

***Note:*** There are some other features which we need to use for best performance like component memoization, using TailwindCss to get minimized version of compiled CSS. etc.
